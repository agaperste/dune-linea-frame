# Frame with Dune Linea API

This repo showcases how to leverage Dune Linea API with a Farcaster Frame to display LXP points alongside with social and onchain metrics.

### Frame Paths

- **Fetch Your Stats**: Gets LXP and related stats if based in your Farcaster ID.
- **Input Wallet Address**: Allows users to enter a specific wallet address to fetch and display metrics.
- **Random Stats**: A fun "Surprise Me" button that fetches random user stats.
